            Memorial day, Peter Luger Steak House, Brooklyn: Kendrick Lamar orders salmon. He is wearing a black <br>
            baseball cap, white t-shirt, and gray-and-blue pants, and I’m seated to his right at an upstairs table forbr  <br>
             10. To my right is Kendrick’s TDE (Top Dawg Entertainment) label-mate, rapper, and friend Jay Rock, <br>
             and the rest of our lunch party is comprised of friends and associates of Kendrick’s: Dave Free, his friend <br>
             since ninth grade, manager, co-director of their groundbreaking videos, and TDE president; Dave’s assistant, Keaton <br>
             Smith; Kendrick’s assistant Derrick McCall; photographer/videographer Chris Parsons; head of TDE security 2Teez;<br>
              TDE general manager ret One; and publicist Ray Alba. Except for Kendrick’s fish choice, everyone else orders <br>
              cheeseburgers and steak—medium rare. Platters of French fries and creamed spinach are brought to the table. Despite <br>
              people sitting at tables all around us, we are le ft alone. Kendrick, who has a reputation as enigmatic and shy, warms up <br>
               as we talk about music, basketball, government, taxes, other rappers, and awards. I tell them that LeBron James wore a <br>
                TDE t-shirt at practice the day before—prior to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. We talk about Madison Square <br>
                 Garden, where, the following night, Kendrick will perform his first sold-out headlining show at the world’s most famous <br>
                 arena as part of the 30-date TDE Championship tour, with a lineup of the label’s artists. We talk about the changes in <br> 
                 Harlem, the changes in Brooklyn, and how New York is no longer the city that never sleeps. There is a wide-ranging <br>
                 conversation about the music Kendrick grew up listening to in Compton, California: the Temptations (he was named for <br>
                 lead singer Eddie Kendricks), Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, and gangsta rap—and I answer queries <br>
                 about my interviews of yesteryear. I tell Kendrick to forget about the three times he was nominated for the best-album <br>
                 Grammy and didn’t win (although I didn’t say it quite so politely) and congratulate him on winning the Pulitzer Prize—  <br>
                 the first for a non-classical or non-jazz musician, and the first for a rapper. Kendrick always appears to be thinking, or  <br>
                  listening, until he breaks into a gap-toothed grin, or a laugh. These guys know each other well—especially Dave and <br>
                   Kendrick, who finish each other’s sentences—and the vernacular is unfiltered, rooted in hip-hop and the streets of Compton.

                Following lunch, we all get into a Mercedes Sprinter, stopping at a pop-up store on Hudson Street in Manhattan that <br>
                sells a clothing collaboration between TDE and Nike (with whom Kendrick also has a shoe deal). Then we head uptown  <br>
                 to an East Side hotel, where he and I sit and talk for over an hour. <br /> <br />
                 In addition to winning this year’s Pulitzer Prize for music, Kendrick Lamar has sold more than 17.8 million albums, been <br>
                  nominated for 29 Grammys, and won 12. His work is archived in the library at Harvard University. He’s been described  <br>
                   as the poet laureate of hip-hop, perceptive, philosophical, unapologetic, fearless, and an innovative storyteller whose <br> 
                   body of work has been compared to James Joyce and James Baldwin. He’s collaborated with—among many others—Jay <br>
                    Z, Eminem, Dr. Dre, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Bono, Pharrell Williams, Jay Rock, and Maroon 5. He writes about being young <br>
                    , black, poor, and gifted in America with a candid self-awareness of who he is, where he’s from, and where he’s been. <br>
                     Musician/producer Pharrell (who worked with Kendrick on the songs “good kid” and “Alright”) had told me, “He’s the <br>
                      Bob Dylan, the Miles Davis of our time, but he’s his own thing. His ability to entertain while educating, without ever <br>
                      being preachy, is amazing.” I ask Kendrick how he balances his enormous success and celebrity with his extreme work <br> 
                      ethic. “You can get put in an environment that can bring down your integrity and your fight,” he says. “What gives me an <br> 
                      advantage in my upbringing is the duality of seeing one of the most beautiful moments of me being 6 years old, to the <br>
                      most tragic moment of being 13 or 14, and make that connection so the person [listening] can really see the conflict. It <br>
                       was a mindfuck, for sure. I would wake up one morning, and it would be cartoons and cereal and walking back from <br>
                        school. And at 4 P.M., we’d be having a house party ‘til 11 P.M. . .. and people [were] shooting each other outside the <br>
                        ` door. That was my lifestyle. And it’s not only mine; it’s so many other individuals’. And I wanted to tell that story. <br /> <br /> <br />
                        <q style="font-family: fantasy;">
                            By the end of listening to his first full album, I felt like I knew everything about him. He brings you <br>
                            into his world with his lyrics in a way that really paints a clear picture. —EMINEM

                Among other individuals to whom his story resonates are the NBA basketball players who grew up either in <br>
                Compton or similar Los Angeles neighborhoods. According to Orlando Magic forward Arron Afflalo—name-<br>
                checked in Kendrick’s song “Black Boy Fly” (“I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo”)—“If you’re in Compton,<br>
                 with all that negativity and violence, and you know you have the talent that Kendrick obviously has, and you<br>
                  watch someone that’s successful, I don’t think ‘jealous’ is a negative word. It’s something that made him hungry; he knew <br>
                  what he could become.” Toronto Raptors’ All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who grew up near Kendrick, says, “Everything he<br>
                   raps about is what we had to overcome and grow through,” and Oklahoma City Thunder All-Star point guard Russell <br>
                   Westbrook adds, “He grew up in the same neighborhoods I grew up in, and to see him be able to explain the struggles of<br>
                    his upbringing through his music is inspirational; he’s opening people’s eyes to what people go through in the inner city.”
